# Website-Blocker-using-TCP-Protocol
A network between client and server in python language with TCP Protocol. 
The project is based on website blocker where particular websites can be blocked by the server and the client cannot access those websites. The timings to block particular site can be set and during that time if a client tries to access the site, it will not open thereby displaying an error that “the website is restricted”.
